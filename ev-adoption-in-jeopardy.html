                <!--Intro-->
                <p>Between 2000 and 2018, the emissions generated by Canada’s transportation sector increased by 27% (Razi and Dincer 2). Light-duty vehicles—cars, trucks, SUVs, and minivans—are responsible for 48% of the sector's greenhouse gas emissions (Neufeld and Massicotte 12). Despite its environmental impacts, the automobile is one of the most important consumer products to Canadians who are highly dependent on their vehicles for mobility (Neufeld and Massicotte 9). Electric vehicles (EVs) are a promising alternative to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, and their adoption can improve air quality and reduce emissions (Renaud-Blondeau et al. 1097).</p>
                <p>Reducing transportation emissions is necessary for Canada to achieve its goal of becoming a carbon-neutral economy by 2050 (Razi and Dincer 2). Transport Canada claims the country is committed to decarbonizing the transportation sector and becoming a leader in zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs). To motivate this industry shift, the federal government unveiled the Electric Vehicle Availability Standard (Gollom). This legislation mandates that all new light-duty vehicles sold must be ZEVs by 2035, with interim sales targets of 20% by 2026, and 60% by 2030 (Transport Canada).</p>
                <p>Canadian officials and EV advocacy groups are optimistic. When Steven Guilbeault, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, unveiled these new mandates last year, he noted the marketplace was already experiencing a “rapid shift toward zero-emission vehicles” (Gollom). Similarly, Louis Levesque, Director of Policy at Electric Mobility Canada, stated “There is currently very high interest, and that interest is growing” (Gollom). However, market research paints a less inspiring picture as Canada’s fragmented approach raises concerns about infrastructure, charging access, and affordability.</p>
               
                <!--Consumer reluctance-->
                <h2 class="fw-regular pb-2">The Market Reality</h2>
                <p>Recent studies suggest consumer reluctance towards EVs is growing (Gollom). In 2024, only 11% of new vehicle shoppers in Canada are considering purchasing an EV, down 3% from the previous year (J.D. Power). In 2023, an Autotrader study suggested EV purchase intention dropped by 12% from 2022 (Gollom). The EV market has grown—Statistics Canada reported that 12% of new vehicles registered in 2023 were ZEVs, 9% more than the year before—but market realities are not yet in sync with the institutional demands for lower-emission products (Gessaroli 13). Rising consumer reluctance has rightfully worried automakers in Canada who are doubtful that demand will support the government’s ZEV sales targets (Mulima).</p>
                <p>Concerns about vehicle range, purchase price, and lacklustre public charging infrastructure sustain Canadian consumer reluctance toward EVs (J.D. Power). Drivers will only make the switch if these worries are addressed. Though the Canadian government remains optimistic, public acceptance and perception determine EV adoption (Razi and Dincer 1). Consumers will purchase the vehicles they need (Mulima).</p>
                
                <!--Infrastructure-->
                <h2 class="fw-regular pb-2">Public Charging Concerns Drive Range Anxiety</h2>
                <p>Range anxiety—a key barrier to EV adoption—is exacerbated by Canada’s poor public charging infrastructure (Springel 353). 68% of consumers disinterested in purchasing an EV cite limited range, and 60% cite access to charging as key factors behind their apprehension (J.D. Power). Most Canadians drive less than 50 kilometres daily, but non-EV owners feel insecure that a lack of chargers would leave them stranded (Razi and Dincer 7). In Canada, geography poses an additional problem as long, desolate stretches of road connecting communities and the limited availability of public charging outside urban centers amplify range concerns (Coulton).</p>
                <p>Currently, 11,500 public charging stations are available across Canada, just short of the 12,000 gas stations operating nationally. However, a single gas station can serve many customers at once in as little as 5 minutes, whereas an EV charging station often only serves one vehicle at a time, and charging can take upwards of an hour (Morgan). The quantity of public charging stations matters, but not all chargers are created equally. Charging speed is a crucial convenience for EV drivers, but level 2 chargers far outnumber their faster level 3 counterparts, which can reduce charging times to as little as 30 minutes (Globe Content Studio). Reliability is another sore point: an August 2023 report found that less than one in five federally funded chargers were operational (Nicholson and Thomas), and broken cables and out-of-service chargers routinely cause headaches for drivers (Globe Content Studio). Ensuring access to charging can boost EV adoption rates (Renaud-Blondeau et al. 1098), and further development of public charging infrastructure can reduce range anxiety and increase consumer confidence (Razi and Dincer 7).</p>
                <p>In 2022, the Canadian federal government announced they would invest $900 million into infrastructure (Globe Content Studio) to have 84,500 public EV charging stations in service by 2029 (Mulima). However, it is anticipated the availability of public charging will fall behind demand (Tumilty), as the number of ZEVs on the road is expected to grow to 5 million by 2030 and reach 21 million by 2040 (Dunsky Energy). Natural Resources Canada estimates the country will need between 442,000 and 469,000 public charging ports by 2035 (Nicholson and Thomas), far outpacing the federal government's current commitment to infrastructure investments.</p>
                <p>The EV market is double-sided: consumer demand depends on existing charging infrastructure, but the supply of charging stations depends on the number of EVs in circulation (Springel 353). Consumers are reluctant to purchase EVs due to infrastructure concerns, and as a result, the private sector is discouraged from investing further due to the low demand (Springel 353). Unlike the 20th-century market evolution that resulted in the construction of gas-fueling infrastructure, implementing public charging infrastructure will require large government expenditures (Gessaroli 29). Drivers have grown accustomed to ICE vehicles and expect refuelling to be accessible, reliable, and convenient. The government must invest further to address the main challenge of deploying public charging infrastructure in numbers comparable with gas stations (Razi and Dincer 2).</p>
                <p>The perceived availability of charging also influences consumer confidence. Public charging awareness can reduce range anxiety and boost interest in EVs: Canadians who had seen public charging stations within their communities were up to 9% more interested in purchasing EVs (Renaud-Blondeau et al. 1100). Proper signage for EV chargers is essential for driving interest (Razi and Dincer 12), particularly amongst non-EV owners who are less sensitive to the infrastructure around them, and often underestimate charging accessibility (Renaud-Blondeau et al. 1108). The perceived availability of public charging can also motivate those who lack access to private charging (Renaud-Blondeau et al. 1108). The Ministry of Transportation in British Columbia has recognized the need for increased visibility, and recently adopted a universal symbol for charging stations (Razi and Dincer 12). But, across the rest of the country, the need to develop a network that meets consumers’ expectations and increases public awareness remains (Renaud-Blondeau et al. 1108)</p>

                <!--Inequity-->
                <h2 class="fw-regular pb-2">Residential Charging Inequities Increase Pressure on Public Infrastructure</h2>
                <p>Charging infrastructure is essential to EV adoption, but public stations only represent half of the equation. Many EV owners prefer to charge at home because it is more convenient and economical. A full transition will require all residential buildings to have their own chargers (Morgan).</p>
                <p>EV adoption is higher in the suburbs where home ownership is more common and it is easier to install private chargers (Coulton). But, in urban centers, maintaining access to public charging is difficult for the millions of Canadians living in multi-unit residential buildings (MURBs), and those relying exclusively on street parking (Yakub). Retrofitting older MURBs with charging stations is expensive and building owners are reluctant to shoulder the cost (Brodsky). Over three million parking spaces must be retrofitted by 2035 to allow multifamily housing residents equitable access to charging. This endeavour will require governmental support through policy changes that require all new residential buildings to be EV-ready and subsidies that reduce the financial burden on building owners and tenants (Dunsky Energy). Investment in this space could empower more drivers living in MURBs to purchase EVs and spur market development for EV-ready apartments to reduce the need for government intervention over time (Yakub).</p>
               <p>Residential charging is an essential component of EV infrastructure, and ensuring all Canadians—even those who live in MURBs—can equitably access at-home charging is crucial to meeting Canada’s ZEV adoption targets (Yakub).</p>
                
               <!--Affordability-->
                <h2 class="fw-regular pb-2">EVs Financially Out of Reach for Many</h2>
                <p>Lagging infrastructure is not the only factor making EV ownership unfeasible. Price premiums on EVs put ownership out of reach for many Canadians. According to the Canadian Black Book, the average price for a new vehicle in Canada is about $60,000, but the price of a new EV is close to $73,000 (Gollom). 61% of new vehicle shoppers cite price as the reason behind their disinterest in EVs (J.D. Power). Though EVs offer comparatively lower running costs, typical Canadian households do not drive enough for an EV to be more cost-effective than an ICE vehicle over its lifecycle (Gessaroli 29).</p>
                <p>Yves Giroux, the Parliamentary Budget Officer says the domestic market will require significant adjustments to meet Canada’s annual ZEV targets (Tumilty). In the meantime, government rebate programs—both provincial and federal—help reduce the price gap between EVs and ICE vehicles. The federal government offers customers up to $5,000 in rebates through the iZEV program (Tumilty). However, higher sales in provinces with additional incentives that can be combined with iZEV, such as Quebec and British Columbia (Coulton), suggest the federal rebate alone fails to make EVs affordable for Canadians.</p>
                <p>Though incentives reduce the financial burden of EV ownership, they come at a high price for the governments that implement them (Thorne and Hughes 520). As a result, many of these programs are set to end in the coming years: Canada’s federal iZEV program expires in 2025 (Jarrat), and Quebec will phase out provincial rebates by 2027 (Yakub). A survey conducted in Quebec by Le Journal-TVA Nouvelles found that without a provincial rebate, 34% of respondents will reconsider purchasing an EV, and only one in four respondents still plan to buy an EV without a subsidy. Across the pond in Germany, EV sales are projected to drop 14%—the first decline in EV sales since 2016—after the abrupt cancellation of government subsidies. Incentives play an important role in motivating consumers. Reducing or eliminating incentives before the price gap between EVs and ICE vehicles is closed threatens adoption rates (Yakub)</p>
                <p>While government incentives help make EV ownership more affordable, to be effective they must be both consistent and significant enough to close the price gap. EV ownership is prohibitively expensive for many Canadians, and those who cannot afford EVs will instead opt to keep their older ICE vehicles longer, reducing the desired positive environmental impact (Gessaroli 12).</p>
                <!--Unified Effort-->
                <h2 class="fw-regular pb-2">Widespread EV Adoption Requires Unified Governmental Effort</h2>
                <p>The federal government has encouraged all provinces to participate in Canada’s plan to electrify the road (Rabson). But politics vary, and the federal government hesitates to involve itself in provincial affairs. As a result, Canada’s EV landscape has become disjointed.</p>
                <p>More progressive provinces such as British Columbia and Quebec have already met Canada’s first target—two years ahead of schedule—as more than 20% of vehicles sold in those provinces are ZEVs (Rabson). In British Columbia, Vancouver and Kamloops have passed bylaws mandating new MURBs to have at least one level 2 charger per parking space (Morgan; Brodsky). The province incentivizes buyers with up to $4,000 in rebates to help purchase a new EV, and used EVs are exempt from provincial sales tax (J.D. Power). British Columbia also offers rebates and grants to install EV chargers (Razi and Dincer 9). In Quebec, costs to implement chargers in the province were previously shared between the public and private sectors, but the approach was unsuccessful. The public utility Hydro-Quebec has since been mandated to handle the deployment of public chargers, and plans to invest $13.1 billion by 2030 into the charging network (Renaud-Blondeau et al. 1100-01). Quebec provides EV buyers with up to $7,000 in financial assistance through a provincial rebate program (J.D. Power) and provides funding for workplaces and residents to install private EV chargers (Razi and Dincer 9).</p>
                <p>Elsewhere, government leadership has stagnated and even reversed course. Ontario previously offered a $14,000 provincial rebate and planned to make changes to the building code to ensure new homes were EV-ready, but these efforts were stifled by Ontario’s Premier Doug Ford in 2018. These policy changes have resulted in lagging public charging infrastructure and lower EV adoption rates. Ontario has only one public charger for every 25 EVs on the road, compared to the global ratio of 1:8. (Morgan).</p>
                <p>The fragmented approach to promoting EV uptake in Canada has resulted in EV sales and public infrastructure varying widely across the country. To achieve its ZEV sales targets, Canada needs a cooperative and coordinated approach involving federal, provincial, and municipal governments nationwide (Coulton).</p>
                
                <!--Norway-->
                <h2 class="fw-regular pb-2">Lessons from Norway’s Success</h2>
                <p>The Canadian government should look to Norway for inspiration where the Norwegian government has successfully shifted consumer preference toward EVs through a decades-long comprehensive effort. Investments in infrastructure and a wide range of consumer incentives have propelled Norway close to reaching its target to phase out ICE vehicles by 2025, the earliest of any country.</p>
                <p>The Norwegian government helped make EVs the best financial choice for consumers (Jaeger). Exemptions from registration fees, value-added tax (VAT), and annual licence fees made EVs more affordable while high fuel taxes and a progressive tax on gas-guzzling ICE vehicles made owning a traditional vehicle more expensive (Soringel 354). Since 2009, Norway has invested heavily in charging infrastructure, and national and local governments spent a combined $15 million between 2010 and 2015. The Norwegian government heavily subsidized or fully covered installation costs of public chargers in urban areas and along major highways (Springel 354). As a result, Norway has the most public chargers per capita of any country in the world (Jaeger).</p>
                <p>Norway’s commitment to investing in supportive infrastructure and incentivizing drivers to purchase EVs has produced measurable success: Norway is the only country in the world where the majority of cars sold are all-electric (Jaeger).</p>
                
                <!--Conclusion-->
                <h2 class="fw-regular pb-2">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Canadians' reliance on the personal automobile has made it one of the most important consumer products of the last century. But, a dependency on fossil fuels as the source to power them has increased greenhouse gas emissions. The Canadian government aims to decarbonize the transportation sector by shifting the market towards ZEVs, but their efforts face significant challenges.</p>
                <p>A successful market transition is dependent on public perception and acceptance. However, concerns over range, price, and public charging infrastructure have made Canadian consumers reluctant to purchase EVs. Further development of the national charging network can address consumer insecurities over range and charging access. But, this will require substantial policy changes and increased government investment. The Canadian government can address affordability woes by further incentivizing drivers through a comprehensive rebate program that makes EVs as affordable as their ICE counterparts. Solving both infrastructure and cost concerns requires an effective and collaborative plan that involves all levels of government in Canada.</p>
                <p>If the Canadian government fails to address consumers' apprehensions, Canadians will remain reluctant to trade the ICE vehicles they have become accustomed to for ZEVs. Without targeted intervention, the federal government's envisioned future of reduced transportation emissions and a carbon-neutral economy will be little more than a distant dream.</p>
