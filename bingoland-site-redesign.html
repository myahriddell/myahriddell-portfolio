                <h2 class="fw-regular pb-2">Context</h2>
                <p>Let’s face it—bingo is for old people. At least, that’s what most people think. While an older demographic typically enjoys Bingo, everyone can enjoy the game. Bingoland Gaming Centre mostly serves a senior clientele but wants to attract new, younger players. While the occasional glow-in-the-dark bingo and exciting performances from drag queens have attracted some younger visitors, outreach and messaging problems have limited the effectiveness of their efforts.</p>
                <p>A lacklustre digital presence dampens Bingoland’s ability to attract younger players. Young adults are incredibly digitally inclined and often evaluate the viability of visiting a new business or participating in a new activity based on digital presence. Is there a website? Social media? What do they look like, and what can be learned from them?</p>
                <p>Bingoland has been hesitant to expand its presence on social media. Some similar gaming establishments post their winners, but many clients are uncomfortable appearing online—especially when holding a big cheque. Another challenge is the nature of the business, which, aside from the infrequent special event is mostly stagnant. The question is: what do we post?</p>
                <p>Though I respect and understand Bingoland’s decision to engage minimally with potential customers through social media, a good website is non-negotiable in our modern, digital world. A website serves as a first impression and is frequently the first point of contact between a business and a potential customer. A good website should communicate what a business offers, why you should visit, and offer insight into what to expect when you visit. This communication should be presented in a format that is visually appealing, responsive, accessible, and well-organized.</p>
                <p>Bingolands current website is dated, poorly optimized for mobile, and is missing a clear information hierarchy. It does little to attract and serve potential and current customers.</p>

                  </figure>
                  <p>The biggest issue is poor organization and structure. The entire website lives on one page, and there is no information hierarchy or separation of concerns. Worse, information is not presented in order of relevancy.</p>
                  <p>The second problem is with the information and context presented. Lots of important information is missing such as pricing information for bingo and taptix, the availability of food service, that Bingoland is cash-only, and how bingo works. Some elements that are included are minimally detailed, such as the Taptix games and machines available. There is no explanation or communication of what to expect when you visit Bingoland, and the website doesn’t give visitors insight into who or what Bingoland is.</p>
                  <p>The look and feel of the website further weakens its impact. The design is dated, unnattraice, and disconnected from Bingoland’s brand. An overreliance on images in lieu of text and integrated web elements make the site feel unpolished and ameatuer. The current site is minimally responsive and poorly optimized for mobile, with some elements becoming jumbled or stretching past the boundaries of their containers.</p>

                <p><b>Guiding Question:</b> How can I leverage visual design to attract younger players, lean into aesthetics associated with the industry, and incorporate Bingoland's brand without anlienating the older clientele Bingoland typically serves?</p>
                <figure class="mb-4 text-center">
                    <img src="Bingoland_Site_Redesign/BLS_StyleGuide_FINAL.png" class="img-fluid rounded w-75" alt="Bingoland Site Style Guide">
                    <figcaption class="mt-2 text-muted">A style guide for Bingoland's new website, created in Adobe InDesign.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>There's no denying the popularity of "dark-mode" has skyrocketed in recent years, especially within younger demographics. A preference for dark mode has emerged for aesthetic purposes. A dark theme matches the branding of Bingoland and fits the vibe typically associated with gambling and entertainment. A dark theme appeals to younger audiences, but is also easier on the eyes when done right which serves older visitors. For these reasons, I designed the new site to be dark-mode by default.</p>
                <p>I chose four different colours by layering white over black at various transparency levels to create a visual heriarchy within a dark-mode design. Then, I took the main brand colour from Bingoland's logo and chose two less saturated versions to use in my design. Finally, I created a triadic colour scheme and chose two additional colours to serve as accents based on the brand colour. I chose these colours in line with Material Design recommendations for dark-mode UIs.</p>
                <p>I wanted the typography to feel clean, inviting, and friendly while matching the font used in Bingoland's logo. I chose a display font that had similar features to the logo font, then chose complimentary fonts in line with my target aesthetic and feel. All fonts are Google Fonts, making them easy to incorporate on the site later.</p>
                <p>The style guide I created matches the intended layout of the site. Floating tiles, soft corners, and hierarchy through shading build on each other to create a soft, iniviting, and modern feel.</p>
                <h2 class="fw-regular pb-2">Prototype</h2>
                <div class="w-100 pb-4" style="position: relative; padding-top: 56.25%;">
                    <iframe 
                      src="https://xd.adobe.com/embed/ee2ed9ef-146b-4d1a-a70b-3b70f122ffe4-bb7d/?fullscreen"

                    </iframe>
                </div>
                <p>Armed with insight, a defined problem, wireframes, and a style guide, I created a hi-fi prototype in Adobe XD. Because this project is currently in the pitching stage, some elements including images, detailed information, and taglines remain incomplete pending feedback and further exploration. All images used in the prototype are rough, placeholder images shot on my iPhone. A completed and launched website would include high-quality, professional, staged photography and videography.</p> 
                <p>While creating my prototype, I made some key changes from my preliminary ideas. I changed the nav bar structure to save space since I would like it to remain in place while scrolling to aid usability. I reordered the links in the nav bar to include the most important pages on each end of the bar, since users are most likely to interact with them. Bingoland's main focus is bingo, and information on visiting the establishment is highly relevant and a core purpose of a buisness website. Some changes were made to layouts based on content and visual design choices. </p>

                <p>User testing is crucial to evaluating the viability of your design, and the success of your decisions. Next, I would select some colleagues and friends within my target demographic to test my prototype. Ideally, I would screen record and time the completion of key tasks on both the existing website, and the new prototype.</p>

                          <p class="fw-bolder">I would conduct user testing using a series of questions and prompts to assess how effectively the prototype enables task completion. The following are some examples:</p>

                            <li>You get off work at 5pm Friday and want to go to Bingo afterwards. What session could you attend?</li>
                            <li>How late is Bingoland open on Tuesdays?</li>
                            <li>How much is the super jackpot prize?</li>
                            <li>What is the jackpot amount for the slot game Cash Eruption?</li>
                            <li>You live in Centretown, is Bingoland close by?</li>
                            <li>You have a question, how can you reach out to Bingoland?</li>
                            <li>Is there an event coming up? If there is, when is it being held?</li>
                          </ul>
                        </div>
                      </div>

                <h2 class="fw-regular pb-2 mb-0">Next Steps</h2>
                <p>I would love to expand upon the explanatory content for new players. While working at Bingoland, I’ve observed a lot of confusion over how the game is run and the rules of the game. Concerningly, some online reviews of Bingoland mention the game's learning curve and point towards poor explanations as a factor. Promoting transparency and accessibility through information delivery is important to me, and I’d love for the website to be able to serve as a guide for the less experienced.</p>
