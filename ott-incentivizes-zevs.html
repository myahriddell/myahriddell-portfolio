                <p>On December 19, 2023, Canada’s Environmental Minister Steven Guilbeault announced a new mandate regarding the sale of zero-emissions vehicles, or ZEVs. The <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/conservation/energy/zero-emission-vehicles.html" target="_blank">Electric Vehicle Availability Standard</a> requires that by 2026, 20 percent of passenger cars, SUVs, and trucks sold must be battery-electric, fuel-cell, or plug-in hybrid vehicles. The Standard also aims to increase ZEV sales each year after, reaching 60 percent by 2030, and 100 percent by 2035. If the mandate is fully reached, Canada could achieve a more than 40 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, lowering total emissions to pre-2005 levels by the year 2030.</p>
                <p>While the number of ZEVs registered annually in Canada has risen since 2020, data released by Statistics Canada in 2023 showed that ZEVs only accounted for 10.3 percent of new vehicle registrations, a long way from the 20 percent goal for 2026. ZEV market share in Canada must double in the next couple of years to meet the federal government’s ambitious target.</p>
                <p>To get more ZEVs on the road, Canadian drivers need to feel confident they can charge their vehicles conveniently and meet their various driving needs. That shift in driver confidence hinges primarily on improving electric charging infrastructure across the country.</p>

                <p>Marty Carr, the Councillor for Alta Vista and the Vice Chair of the Environment and Climate Change Committee in Ottawa, says with Canada’s new ZEV sales targets, the availability of public charging stations is crucial as the rise in popularity will cause a surging demand for better infrastructure. Carr explained the Environment and Climate Change Committee found there weren’t enough charging stations in Ottawa to incentivize and encourage ZEV ownership.</p>

                <p>In 2022, the city installed 14 Level 2 charging stations across the city core, adding to the pre-existing stations in the City Hall, and 2<sup>nd</sup> Avenue parking garages. These sites are operated by the company “Flo”, which maintains over 100,000 charging stations across North America. Carr says these public stations will support residents who cannot charge at home, tourists traveling with electric vehicles, and shift workers. She insists EV owners must be able to charge their vehicles as they need to, and establishing supporting infrastructure to stay ahead of demand is ideal.</p>

                <p>John Fitzgerald, an Ottawa resident, has owned his Tesla Model Y for two and a half years. Fitzgerald says he held off buying an EV while living downtown because his condo wouldn’t permit charging in the building’s parking spots. Opposition from condo boards makes charging at home difficult or impossible for many high-rise renters in Ottawa. Fitzgerald moved to Westboro, where his home charger can accommodate most of his driving needs. Many EV owners prefer to charge at home for convenience and affordability. According to Fitzgerald, public charging infrastructure is most useful when visiting other cities.</p>

                <p>Ottawa’s network of public charging stations was slow to catch on, but usage increased beginning in March and continued to trend upward throughout the remainder of 2022.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>On a station-by-station basis, usage varied widely. Stations at City Hall and 118 Cartier were far more popular than others, with hundreds of recorded annual sessions. However, some stations such as those at 1551 Lycée Place, and 170 Primrose Ave, were visited infrequently, with the former only seeing 62 sessions longer than 5 minutes in the entire year.</p>

                <p>Even the most popular station, City Hall, sat unused for 19 days out of the year. Still, the City Hall site fared better than 118 Cartier St and 930 Wellington St, the second and third most popular sites by this metric. Those stations both had over 120 days in 2022 where they didn’t see any sessions longer than 5 minutes.</p>

                <p>Though data suggests that 8 out of 16 public EV charging stations owned by the city were not in use for more than half of the days in 2022, Carr says the city is not concerned. Instead, Carr explains high usage rates would suggest an existing deficit in availability compared to demand. Carr reiterated that this public charging infrastructure is pre-emptive in nature, and the city expects that demand will increase across the network as ZEV sales grow.</p>

                <p>Charging speed is important to consider as cities like Ottawa continue to install public charging infrastructure. Ottawa’s city-owned chargers only offer Level 2 charging speeds, which provide around 30 kilometres of range per hour. Carr says the city opted for Level 2 chargers because of cost and electricity consumption. These chargers are most effective when drivers intend to spend significant time at their destination. The station at Chapel Hill, a Park N Ride site where users leave their vehicles in favour of public transit, accrued the most hours in use of any charging station, aside from the City Hall location. Despite having only 226 annual sessions compared to City Hall’s 877 sessions, the Chapel Hill station was used for 1534 hours, only 121 less than the City Hall site.</p>
                <p>Level 2 charging speeds reduce the convenience of public stations. According to Fitzgerald, using level 2 public charging stations during a trip to Toronto was challenging. He says drivers must either plan ahead of time or travel out of their way to use a public charging station. For him, the availability of charging can be a major deciding factor while planning trips out of town.</p>
                <p>Carr says that having a mix of charging locations providing different charging speeds is ideal to meet the various needs of ZEV drivers in the city.</p>

                <p>Earlier in June, Mona Fortier, the President of the Treasury Board and Member of Parliament for Ottawa-Vanier announced the city will install 133 more EV charging stations across workplaces and multi-unit residential buildings. While these chargers will be Level 2, not Level 3, they will still help incentivize buyers and help drivers feel more confident charging their vehicles.</p>
                <p>Canada’s new mandate makes one thing clear— ZEVs are the future. As such, the City of Ottawa will continue expanding its public charging network to support existing ZEV owners and incentivize local buyers to choose ZEVs.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2 class="fw-regular">Methodology</h2>
            <p>We focused on a 2022 dataset published by the City of Ottawa detailing the usage of 16 public city charging stations in Ottawa.</p>
            <p>We removed sessions with a recorded length between 0 – 5 minutes total. This comprised 192 entries, representing 3.6% of the overall dataset. It was important to define what qualified as a “meaningful charging session” for our data analysis. Many of the charges were invalid, 39 sessions with a duration of 0 minutes. Since it’s unlikely that anyone gained meaningful value from such short sessions, we removed them to focus on more realistic use of the stations. As the stations are Level 2 charging, such sort sessions wouldn’t yield more than 1 km in distance gained.</p>
            <p>Then, we cleaned and analyzed the dataset using Google Sheets. To enhance readability, we removed columns unnecessary for our purposes, such as transaction ID, session ID, and card number. We used the SPLIT function to fix redundancies within the site column. We used the CONVERT function to change the session time, which was in timecode format, to a number format which works with minutes and hours in raw numbers. We used functions such as UNIQUE, COUNTIF, and SUM, as well as pivot tables to extract summative data on a site-by-site basis.</p>
