                <hr>
               <p>As the earth warms and the environmental crisis worsens, Canada has acknowledged the importance of decarbonizing the transportation sector. Last year, the federal government <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/electric-vehicles-mandates-market-government-1.7066264" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unveiled</a> new mandates regulating the sale of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs). By 2035, all light-duty vehicles sold in the country must be ZEVs. But, as the government dreams of a ZEV future, there’s a big problem—Canadian consumers aren't interested.</p>
               <p>A recent J.D. Power <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-canada-electric-vehicle-consideration-evc-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> revealed that only 11% of Canadian vehicle shoppers are considering an EV, a decline from last year. The majority, 72%, are unlikely to purchase an EV at all, a rising trend. This growing reluctance presents a significant barrier to Canada’s zero-emission future.</p>
               <p>Decreasing consumer interest in EVs is driven by Canada’s lack of a robust public charging network. J.D. Power reports that 68% of new vehicle shoppers are concerned about vehicle range, and 60% are worried about limited public charging station availability. “People won’t buy them if they can’t charge them,” Jennifer French, MPP for Oshawa, <a href="https://www.newmarkettoday.ca/local-news/ontario-lagging-in-charging-infrastructure-needed-for-electric-vehicles-9247723 ">said</a> in the legislature earlier this year. For ZEVs to become mainstream, infrastructure must meet consumers' expectations of convenience, accessibility, and reliability set by the ubiquity of gas stations, and the ease of refuelling with conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.</p>
                <p>The number of ZEVs is <a href="https://www.newmarkettoday.ca/local-news/ontario-lagging-in-charging-infrastructure-needed-for-electric-vehicles-9247723" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">projected</a> to reach 5 million by 2030, and 21 million by 2040. Canada will need up to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canada-electric-vehicles-charging-ports-1.7058158" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">468,000</a> public charging ports by 2035 to meet demand, with over 40,000 new installations required annually between 2025 and 2040. As of <a href="https://electricautonomy.ca/news/2024-03-07/2024-canada-ev-charging-networks-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 2024</a>, only 27,181 charging ports are available across the country, with the government <a href="https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/electric-vehicles/canada-cant-meet-goal-of-100-ev-sales-by-2035-automakers-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pledging to build</a> 84,500 chargers by 2029. However, the number of public charging ports isn’t the only concern. Charging speed is a key convenience, and level 2 chargers <a href="https://electricautonomy.ca/news/2024-03-07/2024-canada-ev-charging-networks-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently outnumber</a> their faster level 3 counterparts that can cut charging times from to a measure of hours to minutes hours to minutes. Reliability is another issue: a <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/federally-funded-charging-stations-operational-1.6952269">study</a> from August 2023 found fewer than 1 in 5 federally funded public chargers were operational. “We have to make sure the consumer is coming along at the pace required to support this transition,” <a href="https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/electric-vehicles/canada-wants-ev-nation-will-consumers-ride" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> Brian Kingston, President of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers Association. Investing in a reliable, convenient, and accessible charging network is necessary for Canada to meet its EV adoption targets.</p>
                <p>Public charging is only part of the equation; for most EV owners, charging at home is more affordable and efficient. But, this <a href="https://nationalpost.com/opinion/owning-an-electric-vehicle-is-madness-and-i-regret-ever-buying-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proves challenging</a> for those who don’t own their homes, or live in multi-unit residential buildings (MURBs) without sufficient private charging infrastructure. Retrofitting older buildings and installing EV chargers in new residential developments is expensive, and condo associations and landlords are reluctant to shoulder the cost. Some cities in British Columbia are making at-home charging more accessible. <a href="https://nationalpost.com/opinion/owning-an-electric-vehicle-is-madness-and-i-regret-ever-buying-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vancouver</a> and <a href="https://www.newmarkettoday.ca/local-news/ontario-lagging-in-charging-infrastructure-needed-for-electric-vehicles-9247723" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kamloops</a> have mandated the installation of charging infrastructure in new residential builds. Elsewhere, government officials are more reluctant. Earlier this year, the Ontario legislature defeated a <a href="https://www.newmarkettoday.ca/local-news/ontario-lagging-in-charging-infrastructure-needed-for-electric-vehicles-9247723" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">motion</a> that would have required new homes to include basic wiring to install EV chargers. Since <a href="https://electricautonomy.ca/news/2023-08-03/the-atmospheric-fund-ev-ready-murbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one-third</a> of Canadians live in MURBs, ensuring equitable access to at-home charging through government funding, and a mandated right-to-charge, is crucial to making ZEV ownership feasible for everyone.</p>
                <p>Canada should look to Norway for inspiration, where a range of incentives, tax exemptions, and investments in public charging have <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/countries-adopting-electric-vehicles-fastest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shifted consumer preference</a> towards EVs. Crucially, Norway has mandated a right-to-charge for those living in apartment buildings, supported by government funding, ensuring that even those in MURBs can access essential infrastructure. Thanks to deliberate government effort, most vehicles sold in Norway are all-electric, and the country has the highest number of public fast chargers per capita.</p>
               <p>Affordability is another obstacle to EV adoption. <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-canada-electric-vehicle-consideration-evc-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">61%</a> of Canadian shoppers say they won’t consider a ZEV because of price. Canada's federal rebate program, <a href="https://tc.canada.ca/en/road-transportation/innovative-technologies/zero-emission-vehicles/incentives-zero-emission-vehicles-izev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incentives for Zero-Emission Vehicles</a> (iZEV), offers shoppers up to $5,000 in support, but it's not enough to close the price gap between ZEVs and ICE vehicles. Consumers are <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-canada-electric-vehicle-consideration-evc-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more likely</a> to purchase ZEVs in Quebec and British Columbia, which have large provincial rebates that buyers can combine with iZEV. The incentive disparity likely explains Toronto's <a href="https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/electric-vehicles/canada-wants-ev-nation-will-consumers-ride" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slower EV adoption</a> compared to Vancouver and Montreal, as Ontario lacks a provincial rebate program. The federal rebate program, iZEV, <a href="https://electricautonomy.ca/policy-regulations/ev-rebates-incentives-funding/2024-03-21/quebec-ev-sales-rebate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expires</a> in 2025, leaving drivers in provinces without a rebate program to shoulder the financial burden on their own. Without a consistent, long-term federal incentive program, consumers will remain hesitant, and ZEVs will continue to be financially out of reach for many Canadians.</p>
                <p>If the Canadian government is serious about decarbonizing its transportation sector, deliberate, large-scale investment and regulatory efforts must address critical infrastructure, access, and affordability issues. As Canadians grow more disinterested in ZEVs, without further government action, Canada’s EV dream will remain just that—a dream. </p>
